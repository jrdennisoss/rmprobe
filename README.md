# Overview

This repository contains tools I am using to learn how the ReelMagic stuff works.


# Included Tools

* `recorder` is a tool used to intercept and log an application's interaction with ReelMagic
* `rmprobe` is a tool used to peek/poke at the ReelMagic driver from the command line
* `rmsdk` is an attempt to re-create the C SDK used for programs wishing to use the ReelMagic hardware.
